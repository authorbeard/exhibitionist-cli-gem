# Contributor Code of Conduct

I don't really believe this is necessary. Restrict your comments to specific contributions and code, not to contributors. And I'm the only maintainer right now, so I reserve the right to remove anything I don't like, and I don't promise to give any explanations. 

But I have a hard time seeing myself actually paying that much attention to whether you're being nice or mean (or thin-skinned and contentious). 

I generally agree with the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],
version 1.3.0, available at
[http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/][version], but I'm not going to bind myself to monitoring everyone for niceness, nor will I commit to defining beforehand all the ways you can get on my bad side.
